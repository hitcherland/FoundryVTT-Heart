# Heart - The City Beneath

This is a simplistic implementation of [Heart - The City Beneath](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/heart-the-city-beneath-rpg/) for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) . It provides a character sheet based on the one provided inside Heart. Includes a number of useful dynamic tools for rolling and assessing results.
## Features

* Character sheets to track all the stuff you want to track
    * Resistances, Protections
    * Name, Class, Calling
    * Beats, Equipment, Resources, Abilities, Fallout, Skills, Domains
    * Notes
* Multiline inputs use FoundryVTT's inbuilt rich text editor
* Skills can be checked, as expected
* Resistances and Protections can be increased and decreased by clicking on the boxes.
* Rollable buttons (and macros for the GM) in character sheets for rolling, stress and fallout.
* Clickable chat messages to perform rolls.

## Usage

Buttons are available in the character sheet for players, or from the hotbar via macros for the GM.

### Roll Requests

A roll request is a clickable chat message that allows the players to roll with specific parameters. Rolls can be made via: 
* "Request Roll" button in a Character Sheet
* "Prepare Roll Request" Macro

Clicking on either of these will open a window like below:

![Blank Roll Request window](readme-imgs/heartblankrollrequest.png)
 
For example, preparing a roll request like this:

![Preparing a Roll Request](readme-imgs/heartrollrequest.png)

will create a chat message like this:

![Roll Request in Chat](readme-imgs/heartrollrequestchatmsg.png)

### Rolls

This is a typical "Heart" `1d10` roll. Rolls can be made with the following: 
* "Roll" button in a Character sheet
* "Roll" button in chat message
* "Prepare Roll" Macro

As before, this will open a new window. 

![Prepare roll](readme-imgs/heartblankroll.png)

Again, this might result in chat messages like:

![Success roll](readme-imgs/heartrollsuccess.png)
![Failure roll](readme-imgs/heartrollfailure.png)

### Stress

We also can manage stress rolls.

Stress rolls can be made with the following: 
* "Roll Stress" button in a Character sheet
* "Roll Stress" button in chat message
* "Prepare Stress Roll" Macro

From the macro:

![Prepare stress roll](readme-imgs/heartstressroll.png)

From chat:
![Stress Roll button](readme-imgs/heartfailurestressrollbutton.png)

which might result in:

![Stress chat message](readme-imgs/heartstressresult.png)

You can then "Take Stress" by clicking the new button. This applies the stress to the character's appropriate resistance.

### Fallout

We also can manage fallout rolls. Stress rolls can be made with the following: 
* "Roll Fallout" button in a Character sheet
* "Prepare Fallout Roll" Macro

An example chat message as a result:

![Fallout Chat Message](readme-imgs/heartrollfallout.png)

You will get a result and an accompanying button to clear the appropriate stress:

## Translations

If you're considering writing a translation, firstly: thank you! You can provide translation files in two ways:

## Method 1: Send me a single lang/{lang}.json file

Find [lang/en.json](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/blob/release/lang/en.json) and translate it, then send the file to me.

This method is easier for you, but requires me to do some work to adjust it to the format I use for the [development branch](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/tree/development) that I use to actually build the system. This means it is subject to me getting around to it, which has previously taken a few months.

## Method 2: Submit A Pull Request to the Development Branch

You can find the development branch [here](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/tree/development). As mentioned above, this is the branch that actually builds the "release" branch. Fork the repo, and modify the duplicate the many instances of the `lang/en.json` file. You can find these by searching for `en.json`, (e.g. in Github, by going to [Find a File](https://github.com/hitcherland/FoundryVTT-Heart/find/development) and typing `en.json`).

This is easier for me (and quicker for you), as I can just accept it directly.

## Contributing
It is not recommended to develop on the instance on Foundry you run games from. If you need help installing another version of Foundry or a dev environment this isn't the guide for that.

To test your changes:

Add your Foundry installation's Data location to `foundryvtt.config.js` it should look something like:
`foundryvttPath: "/home/yourusername/foundryuserdata/Data"` 

Inside this directory run:
```shell
npm ci
npm run build .
```

If everything is setup correctly this will create a symlink from this directory's `dist` folder to your Foundry systems folder. It will then build this project and the built version will appear in `dist`. With the symlink in place you can then open Foundry and interact with the system as normal.
